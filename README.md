# Digital signage screen content for EDSH

This repository serves as content source for the Kiosk screens / digital signage at the restaurant of EDSH.de.

There are three displays mounted above the bar, like in a sports bar, that display various content to the customers. This content is defined by the HTML contained in the subfolders `alfa`, `bravo`, `charlie` for the respective screen.

The implementation is ridiculously simple, so don't expect any rocket science here.
